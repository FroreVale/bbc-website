## BBC Website

To learn more about frontend and CSS, I built the frontpage of BBC website from scratch. You can see it [here](https://bbc-website-pi.vercel.app/). I really enjoyed the process and thought I could finish it in a day even though the lead frontend developer at BBC would've disagreed with me but I didn't and it took almost a week.

Hey I'm looking for a job. If you like it, just text me.
